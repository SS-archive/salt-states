# Set this if the client doesn't report the correct hostname when

#host_name localhost.localdomain

# A list of addresses that are allowed to connect.  This must be a
# regular expression, since Net::Server does not understand CIDR-style
# network notation unless the perl module Net::CIDR is installed.  You
# may repeat the allow line as many times as you'd like


# Add Allowed IPs Here
allow ^127\.0\.0\.1$
allow ^10\..$

# If you have installed the Net::CIDR perl module, you can use
# multiple cidr_allow and cidr_deny address/mask patterns.  A
# connecting client must match any cidr_allow, and not match any
# cidr_deny.  Example:

# cidr_allow 127.0.0.1/32
# cidr_allow 192.0.2.0/24
# cidr_deny  192.0.2.42/32

# Which address to bind to;
host *
# host 127.0.0.1

# And which port
