# Minimal Travis verfication for salt states

# Since salt/salt states aren't a language proper, this is a hackaround for now
# We should probably build a basebox for travis at some point
#    (see https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1549)
language: python
python:
- '2.7'

before_install:
  - sudo apt-get update -y
  # Install salt minion on the same box
  - curl -L http://bootstrap.saltstack.org | sudo sh -s -- git develop
  # Set up our installation bits
  - sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt/states
  - sudo cp .travis/minion /etc/salt/minion

install:
  # Copy the states and restart
  - sudo cp -r . /srv/salt/states
  - sudo service salt-minion restart

  # If anything bad happened on restarting the minion,
  # we'll want to see the logs
  - sudo cat /var/log/salt/*

  # For additional debugging, see what's in grains on a travis box
  - sudo salt-call grains.items --local

script:
  - sudo salt-call state.show_lowstate --local --retcode-passthrough
