Salt States
===========

This repository is intended as a collection of salt states which can be 
checked out and used. 

Since Salt is intended as a means to control minion state and flow this is
a needed step in developing more powerful state management.

Using this Repository
---------------------

Clone this repository to get started. SLS implementations are provided 
as working examples and possible good configurations. Every effort is made
to ensure the quality and upkeep of this repository. 

Once cloned, there are several example top.sls files for review. The 'top.sls'
is used to implement every state declaration, with the exception of the absent
declarations.
